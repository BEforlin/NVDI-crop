# NVDI-crop
Crop mozaic of aerial drone footage using OpenCV


Code for a University project. The objective was to put together a mozaic of crop images, using aerial drone footage and ground markers.
The inputs consisted of aerial drone footage of colored images and infrared images of the same crop field. The six colored images should be put together eliminating overlaps. The resulting frame was then used to guide the overlap of IR footage, where the markers are invisible. With a full image it was possible to get the NVDI index to evaluate crop growth. The lens distortion of the IR camera was not corrected for this project.
